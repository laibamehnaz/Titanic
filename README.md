# Titanic (Kaggle Competition)
In this challenge, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we're asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
For each PassengerId in the test set, we must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.
Score is the percentage of passengers we correctly predict.
